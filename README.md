# Remindish

### Our Mission
We want to help prevent food waste simply because it has passed its expiration date. Most people don't realize how much food they throw away every day â€” from uneaten leftovers to spoiled produce to parts of fruits and vegetables that could be eaten or repurposed. A third of all food in the United States goes uneaten. EPA estimates that in 2018, about 81% - 20.3 tons - of households' wasted food ended up in landfills or combustion facilities.

### What We Do
Remindish allows you User log in with your name and phone number you can add a food item with basic information (name, category, purchase date, expiration date). Food item is stored in a database. Remindish will check for any food item to expire in the following week. A notification sent to you about the food set to expire soon Remindish will send a notification to you letting you know which food items are set to expire in the following week.
