      <h2 class="mission">Our Mission</h2>
      <p>We want to help prevent food waste simply because it has passed its expiration date.Most people don't realize
        how much food they throw away every day â€” from uneaten leftovers to spoiled produce to parts of fruits and
        vegetables that could be eaten or repurposed.</p>
      <p>One-third of all food in the United States goes uneaten. EPA estimates that in 2018, about 81 percent - 20.3
        tons - of households' wasted food ended up in landfills or combustion facilities.<p>
